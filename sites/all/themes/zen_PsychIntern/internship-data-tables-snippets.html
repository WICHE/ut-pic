<h2>Internship Program Admissions</h2>

<p>Briefly describe in narrative form important information to assist potential applicants in assessing their likely fit with your program. This description must be consistent with the program’s policies on intern selection and practicum and academic preparation requirements:</p>

<h3>AK-PIC Training Sites</h3>

<p>The consortium includes the following sites: Alaska Psychiatric Institute; Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association; Hope Counseling Center; Providence Family Medicine Center/Alaska Family Medicine Residency; and Norton Sound Health Corporation. Each site is described below.</p>

<p>The Consortium offers one-year, full-time internship placements that begin and end around July of each year. The Consortium is comprised of treatment centers throughout Alaska and will provide a range of clinical and didactic experiences that represents the necessary depth and breadth required for future professional practice with Alaska’s diverse communities. Interns will have a primary placement at one site and will complete Alaska Specific Experiential Activities (AK-SEA) at other sites within the consortium. Across training sites, interns will complete a minimum of 500 hours per internship year of face-to-face direct service delivery.</p>
